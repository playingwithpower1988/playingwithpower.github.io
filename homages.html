			<h1>Homage Cover</h1>
			<img src="images/nintendo-power-fan-cover.png" alt="Homage Nintendo Power cover made by Leo Lopez" class="round">
			<p>This is a homage cover to the classic era of <i>Nintendo Power</i>. I made it in 2019 when I was first in college for an assignment of a fake magazine cover.</p>
			<p class="tablet-desktop">The subheading "Blast from the Past" is actually a pun in three different ways:</p>
			<ul class="tablet-desktop">
				<li>I was "bringing back" a magazine from the 90s and emulating its look in its prime</li>
				<li>The Mega Man series, a classic game series from the late 80s and early 90s, was being brought to the Nintendo Switch</li>
				<li>Mega Man has a blaster on his arm</li>

			<p>This is a logo made specifically for this website as a homage to the classic era logo of <i>Nintendo Power</i>.</p>
			<p class="tablet-desktop">Since it was such a quick mockup, there's quite a few mistakes and things that could use some work:</p>
			<ul class="tablet-desktop">
				<li>The stroke outlines for the text and the lines need to be adjusted, including adjusting the bold backdrop effect for the text</li>
				<li>The text itself needs to be manually edited to match the font style of the original, with blockier "O's" and rounder "R's"</li>
				<li>The lines on the sides of the words need to have a slight indent-y space at the edges to make it more ribbed-like than a flat line</li>

			<p>This is a hero image made specifically for this website as a homage to the classic era logo of <i>Nintendo Power</i>.</p>
			<p class="tablet-desktop">Just like the logo, since it was a quick mockup, there's some things that could still use some work:</p>
			<ul class="tablet-desktop">
				<li>Like the logo, the text itself needs to be manually adjusted to better match the font seen on the cover of the magazine</li>
				<li>The spacing could still be adjusted</li>
				<li>The line under "the" is a little rough and uneven and could be fixed up to look cleaner</li>

			<h1>Fun Facts</h1>
			<p>Here are some fun facts about the homage cover, homage logo, custom hero image, and about this website.</p>
			<dl>
				
				<dt><b>Homage Cover</b></dt>
				<dd>When it came time to present my cover in front of the class, at first my classmates and professor thought at first I just ripped an existing cover and submitted it as my own! They ended up asking to see the .psd Photoshop file to see for themselves that I actually made it myself and didn't plagiarize. My professor back then also let me use the media arts lab to print it out on a vinyl banner to own for myself, and I still have it about seven years later. Looking back, there's some things I think I'd do differently, but I'm still rather proud of it. In fact, I like to half jokingly say it's one of my "magnum opus" works. There aren't many clean rips/scans of the classic covers, so I referenced a lot of them and had to find ways to recreate them as cleanly as possible, including searching for fonts that were close enough or at least emulated a classic 90's gaming feel (I believe the cover I referenced the most was Volume 31). I even hand drew the little line under "the" to make it as official looking as possible! Most people think I spent a couple days making it between gathering the resources needed and putting it all together, but the truth is, I actually crunched it the night the assignment was due and submitted it just in time (don't be like me and let procrastination almost catch up to you). I hope you'll forgive the watermark; I'd rather have it than not have it.</dd>
				
				<dt><b>Homage Logo</b></dt>
				<dd>I had the (extremely ambitious) idea to make a homage logo just for this website assignment on top of the actual assignment work (which was, of course, the coding aspect.) While I could've <!-- gone what I felt was the "easy way out" and utilize-->utilized text <!--for the site--> instead, I don't think it would've felt complete to me unless I at least attempted to make a logo. In order to make it, I had to find a free font that was as close to the <i>Nintendo Power</i> logo as possible before getting to work in Photoshop. I ended up using <i>Roboto</i>, the same font I used for the main content of this site. I didn't get to spend as much time as I wanted to, so it's a lot rougher and way more basic than if I had the time to actually sit down and perfect it. While I wish I knew how to use Illustrator so it could be vector based instead of raster based, I just made do in the software I already knew how to use. Hopefully at least the sentiment of it shines through! I hope you'll forgive the watermark here as well.<!--, even if it's a bit useless since the logo actually used for the site isn't watermarked.--></dd>
				
				<dt><b>Hero Image</b></dt>
				<dd>Since a magazine cover wasn't going to cut it for a hero image, I had to think fast as to what I could use for one. Since I was already being ambitious in making a custom logo for the sight, I thought to myself, "Well, why not be just make a hero image as well?" Since the custom logo is supposed to invoke the same feel as the original <i>Nintendo Power</i> logo, I figured I could invoke the bottom of every cover that had the slogan of "The source for [x] straight from the pros." Like the fake cover I made, I also hand drew the little line under "the." It's a little bit more rushed than the logo, but I wanted it to have at least somewhat of the same type of authentic feel that I initially aimed for with the homage cover, and then again for the logo for this site. Like the other two, I hope you'll forgive the watermark here also.<!-- While I watermarked the version here for consistency's sake, it's like the logo in that it's a bit useless that I did so given the homepage's hero image isn't watermarked.--></dd>
				
				<dt><b>Homage Website</b></dt>
				<dd>If you can't tell by now, I have a tendency to have ambitious ideas and a (sometimes almost over my head) drive to complete them to the best of my ability. When I first saw that the class, <i>MIT 149 - Intro to Web Design</i>, would have an assignment in which we'd create our own website, I had the immediate thought that it'd be really cool to call back to the homage cover I made years ago. And while I kept thinking to myself, "Maybe I should <!-- stick with something more within the realm of reason-->do something else instead..." I also couldn't stop thinking about how cool it'd be to have it all "tie together", so to speak. So, I ended up biting the bullet and made <i>Nintendo Power</i> the focus of this assignment as well. The main font for the site is <i>Roboto</i>. It's the closest free font I could see that matched the main look of the original magazine well enough. While I couldn't quite find a font that matched the font that was often used on the cover for game titles and big headlines, I still made the decision to use <i>Pridi</i>, a serif font, for the navigation areas and <i>Roboto</i>, a sans-serif font, for the main content, to match the way the magazine covers did the same. I wanted to be as in-depth as I could manage in the time that I had to make the site; the phone number listed in the contact section is even a reference to the magazine title ((NIN) TEN-PWER = (646) 836-7937)! The color scheme I feel could be adjusted; I stuck with a more grayscale approach overall for personal accessibility reasons and because using the bright color <!--red-orange and yellow--> scheme of the classic magazine look would definitely be far too much eyestrain for an entire site. I couldn't immediately think of a color scheme that would match well enough and not hurt your eyes to view, but at least its functional enough.</dd>
